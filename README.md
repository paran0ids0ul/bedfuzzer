#[ About --+

  BED is a program which is designed to check daemons for
  potential buffer overflows, format string bugs et. al.

  BED simply sends the commands to the server and checks
  whether it is still alive afterwards.

  Of course this will not detect all bugs of the specified
  daemon but it will (at least it should) help you to
  check your software for common vulnerabilities.


#[ Version --+

  0.42 - "What is the question?"

#[ Notice --+

  On success, BED WILL CRASH THE DAEMON, so do not test
  on critical and important systems.
  We are not responsible for any problems accuring during
  running our software.
